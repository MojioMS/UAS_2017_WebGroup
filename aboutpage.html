<p> This student project is dedicated to Unmanned Aerial System Course 2017. The main objective of this project is to implement emerging unmanned aerial methods to perform environmental analysis.
The excursion site is located in Aa River Muenster with 100 meter long test area, focusing in the curving area of the river. In recent year, re-naturalization researches and effort of Aa River have been conducted. The curving area is the main indicator of the re-naturalizatio processes.
 Hence, we conduct Image and Video analysis around the curving area of Aa River. This website means to convey following products.</p>
